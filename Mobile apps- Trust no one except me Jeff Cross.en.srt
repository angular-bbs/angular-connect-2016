1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:01,260
大家好
JEFF: Hello.

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:02,260
谢谢
Thank you.

3
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:04,930
在开始前  我们先做点小事儿
Before we get started, I actually need to go over something.

4
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:06,890
这是我的孩子们
These are my boys.

5
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:09,160
等我从这个会场回家之后  我要做的第一件事就是
The first thing I do when I come home from a conference is show

6
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,890
把我的这段演讲视频给他们看
them the video of my talk.

7
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:14,740
所以  我希望在场的各位（如果可能的话）配合我这样做
So, what I would like for everyone here to do, if you could,

8
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:18,030
我假装很投入  而你们则尽可能大声的笑  这样一来
is me to pretend to come on stage and you cheer as loudly as you can, so, when

9
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:21,270
当我回到家的时候  他们就会觉得每个人都很喜欢他老爹我
I come home, they think everyone loves their daddy.

10
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:24,260
我马上就要翻到幻灯片首页  然后开始激情演讲
I'm going to run up on the title slide, and run up on to the stage.

11
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:30,869
开始大笑吧  能多大声就多大声
As loud as you can will be great.

12
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:32,529
谢谢
Thank you!

13
00:00:32,529 --> 00:00:35,829
请坐
[CHEERING] . JEFF: Sit down!

14
00:00:35,829 --> 00:00:37,489
请坐
Sit down!

15
00:00:37,489 --> 00:00:39,831
这真是远超我的期待
I've got a lot to go over.

16
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:40,831
非常感谢
Thank you so much.

17
00:00:40,831 --> 00:00:42,420
能来这里真是太好了
It's great to be here.

18
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,609
朋友们  开始吧  我这次要讲的很多
Guys, come on, I've got a lot to cover!

19
00:00:45,609 --> 00:00:52,149
我是 Jeff Cross  头衔是 Angular 移动技术组的 Tech Lead
So, I'm Jeff Cross, the tech lead of the mobile team on Angular, and as the title says,

20
00:00:52,149 --> 00:00:55,999
我大概是这次大会中最值得信任的人了
I'm probably the most trustworthy person here at the conference.

21
00:00:55,999 --> 00:00:58,190
如果你这次只打算听一个演讲
If you're going to one talk the whole time, this is

22
00:00:58,190 --> 00:00:59,679
这一个可能是最好的
probably the best one to be at!

23
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:01,469
今天你实际上能用一场演讲的钱听两场
You actually get two talks for the price of one today,

24
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:06,640
因为我的同事 Alex Rickabaugh 将会在我的演讲结束之后再讲一场
because my colleague, Alex Rickabaugh, is going to give a talk right after mine.

25
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,940
Alex 和我就像是超级男孩乐队  我们一起合作  
Alex and me are like the band Nsync where we collaborate

26
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:15,720
一起出专辑  但有时我们也独自做项目
together and make albums together, but once in a while, we make solo

27
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,720
projects.

28
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,410
我就是 Justin Timberlake （超级男孩乐队的队长）
I'm Justin Timberlake.

29
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:27,980
我们一回去就会制作酷炫的移动应用
We will be getting back to work to make mobile awesome.

30
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:32,440
我这次的目标就是传授你一些知识  让你自己决定你的移动应用该选用
My goal is to equip you with the knowledge so that you can decide a mobile

31
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:37,010
何种策略   这就像挑选工具  为正式的应用而不是为自家的玩具应用
strategy for your applications, like clicking the tools - picking the tools and strategies

32
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:41,460
而选取工具和策略
to use for serious applications, not the toy apps you build at home.

33
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,310
Alex 会讲述制作大多数移动 Web 方面的开发经验
Alex is going to talk about making the most of your mobile

34
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,480
web experience.

35
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,760
我一共有 20 分钟
I've got 20 minutes.

36
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,760
我们要怎样才能填满这 20 分钟呢？
What can we fit in 20 minutes?

37
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:53,880
我想我们可以评估并比较每一个工具、库以及
I think we can evaluate and compare every tool, library and

38
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:59,900
移动开发方面的理念  或者  偏实践一点  我们可以聚焦于和Angular有关的那些细节
idea in the mobile landscape, or, maybe to be practical, we can focus on the pieces that

39
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:04,050
也就是点评Angular所集成的具体工具
pertain to Angular, so - Angular looking at tools that are specifically integrated with

40
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:10,379
这样我就能讲得更快一点儿  我将会
- I'm going to be talking fast, I'm going to

41
00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:12,879
共享这些幻灯片  它们当中包含了大部分信息
share the slides, they've got lots of information inside.

42
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,660
即使你错过了  以后也能靠它们追上来
If you get lost, you'll catch up later.

43
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:20,489
我们先来看看一些移动技术爱好者  他们远比我们
Let's take a look at some of the mobile enthusiasts who go on and on about their

44
00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:25,379
更关心这些工具
tools way longer than any of us care to hear about them.

45
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:41,799
公平起见  我们先从 Angular 移动技术组开始
To be fair, we will start with the Angular Mobile Team.

46
00:02:41,799 --> 00:02:43,299
对渐进式 Web 应用  我们讲了很多
>> We talk a lot about progressive web apps.

47
00:02:43,299 --> 00:02:51,840
我们在构建这些渐进式 Web 应用方面投入了很多时间
It's where we spend a lot of our time is building these progressive web apps.

48
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,930
这种思路可以让构建出的 Web 应用具有与
It's just a way of thinking about building web apps

49
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:58,540
原生应用相似的操作感和行为
to feel like installed native applications to have the same kind of feel and behaviour,

50
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:03,370
可以安装到首屏  可以离线工作  可以立即工作  等等
installing the home screen, working offline, working instantly, those kind of things.

51
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,090
对渐进式 Web 应用  我们谈论了那么多  但问题在于
So we talk a lot about it, and the question is

52
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:08,299
在目前的技术条件下  它是现实的应用构建方案吗？
it the one true way to build applications today?

53
00:03:08,299 --> 00:03:11,680
你能放下构建应用时所考虑的一切吗？
Can you drop everything you thought about building applications?

54
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,829
能单独构建渐进式 Web 应用吗？
Can just build progressive web apps?

55
00:03:13,829 --> 00:03:15,510
我们稍后再探讨它
We will look into that later.

56
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:20,159
首先  我们看看另一些爱好者
First, let's look at some other enthusiasts.

57
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:26,779
[Audio played].

58
00:03:26,779 --> 00:03:29,569
Adam 是一个 Ionic 开发者
Adam is a developer on Ionic as you can from the five

59
00:03:29,569 --> 00:03:31,560
你从他五次谈到 Ionic 就能看出来
times he said it.

60
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,569
也许每个人都听说过 Ionic
Everyone has heard of Ionic, probably.

61
00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:38,930
它是构建于 Cordova 之上的一个混合式（Hybrid）应用方案
It's a cool hybrid thing built on Cordoba.

62
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:46,109
你可以把它们装在手机上  为其添加原生特性  这样一来  它既有
You can put them on phones, add native features, while having a nice

63
00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:51,560
良好的用户体验又能与 Web 应用共享代码以及复用你的 Web 开发技能
experience and sharing code with web apps and using your web app skills.

64
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,760
于是我们得到了一个渐进式Web应用
We've got progressive web apps.

65
00:03:53,760 --> 00:04:00,409
还有什么别的方式？
What else do we have?

66
00:04:00,409 --> 00:04:03,069
[Audio played].

67
00:04:03,069 --> 00:04:05,090
还有一个产品  名叫 Native Script
So there is a product called native script.

68
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:06,090
如你所见
As you saw there.

69
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:14,870
Luke Luke Luke NativeScript 是另一种截然不同的方式[#TODO]
Luke Luke Luke will be native script is a kind of different approach.

70
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:18,510
和 Cordova 不同  这并不是 Hybrid 技术  不过你照样可以写
It's not hybrid in the same sense as Cordova but you to get to write

71
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:27,690
JavaScript 和 TypeScript 运行时也像个应用程序，但它的UI是原生的
JavaScript and TypeScript and it runs at the same time as the application but you have

72
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:33,720
具备硬件访问能力  平滑的滚屏  以及大量缓动效果等
native UI, with hardware acceleration, nice smooth scrolling, all that with a lot of ease.

73
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,530
于是  我们有了三个相互竞争的候选技术
So we've got these three contenders.

74
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:37,340
嗯  你知道吗？
And, you know what?

75
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,640
在特定的场景中并不一定要使用单一的策略
No single strategy has to be used in isolation.

76
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:44,670
可能多数情况下会使用它们的某种组合  可能是 Web 和 NativeScript
Probably most will be combined with something else, maybe web

77
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:49,730
也可能是 Web 和 Ionic
and NativeScript, maybe web and Ionic.

78
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:55,510
我们要看看它们如何互相取长补短  
We want to look at how they complement each other, what are the strengths and advantages

79
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:58,290
看看你所做的选择  其强项和优点何在
are the different choices you might make?

80
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:03,220
所以  我们今天要问的问题是  我们需要一个 Web 应用吗？
So the questions we want to answer today are: do I need a web app?

81
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,380
也就是说  我们要构建一个
Is it strategically sound to have it built as a

82
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,440
没有原生组件的 Web 应用吗？
web app with no native component?

83
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:12,920
如果理由不充分或不必要  那么我们是该用 Hybrid 还是 Native 
If it is not sufficient or necessary, should I use hybrid

84
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:18,030
还是类似的工具？
or native JavaScript or some tools like them?

85
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:21,030
我们来看看Angular大陆Mobile王国的南部[#TODO]
Let's look and the South of mobile in Angular land.

86
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:26,620
我把这些分为四类：分发 —— 用户如何拿到你的应用；
I've got four categories I've broken this down to: distribution, how users

87
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:31,180
能力 —— 有哪些API？在各种不同的方式下，你能或不能做到什么？
get a hold of your app; capabilities - what are the APIs, the things you can and can't

88
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,770
do with different approaches?

89
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:36,650
性能 —— 在各种不同的方式下，性能的特征是怎样的？
Performance, what are the performance characteristics of

90
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:37,960
different approaches?

91
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,930
生产率 —— 在使用不同工具时  你团队的开发效率如何？
Productivity: how effective is your team going to be with different

92
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:42,030
tools?

93
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:47,450
先从分发开始讲起  用户要如何获得你的应用？
Starting with distribution, how do users get your app?

94
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:49,190
可搜索性是一个很重要的因素
Searchability is a big factor here.

95
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:51,950
用户如何通过搜索引擎或应用商店找到该应用？
How do they find it in search engines and app stores?

96
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:54,520
可分享性  如何通过你的应用分享内容  或者
Share-ability, how does content from your app get shared or

97
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,760
如何分享你的应用本身？ 
how does your app itself get shared?

98
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,890
首次使用时的体验
The first-use experience.

99
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:01,220
当用户听说了你的应用时  就会通过搜索引擎或其它什么地方来查找它
When a user hears about your app, finds it in a search engine,

100
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:05,480
用户查找时能有多容易？以及  你的应用该如何升级？
finds it somewhere else, how easily can they use it, and how does the updating of

101
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,280
your app occur?

102
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,400
要想获得可搜索性  用户该如何通过搜索引擎来发现这些内容？
Getting into searchability, how do users discover the content via search

103
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,400
engines?

104
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:17,550
有趣的是：Alex和我所属的公司被称为Google，而这个公司
There is an interesting fact: the company Alex and I work for is called

105
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:22,650
在1997年就已经存在了  在那里你可以在输入框中输入任何想找东西
Google, and we have had this website since about 1997 where you can type in anything

106
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:26,990
然后Google就会试图在整个互联网上找到
you want in a text field and it will look around the whole internet and try to find

107
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:29,660
你想要的内容
content that matches what you want.

108
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,970
我们提供一些广告  而当用户点击广告这些时
We have ads on it, and, when people click those

109
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:33,440
我们就能因此而赚到钱
ads, we get money for it.

110
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,440
这也是我们资助Angular开发的方式
This is how we fund Angular development.

111
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,860
Angular看起来像个伟大的项目  但是我们要
Angular seems like this great project but we have to make

112
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:41,750
以某种方式赚到钱  我们的做法就是这样
make money somehow and that's how we do.

113
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:48,630
人们查找应用、内容、新文章等等就是主流方式
It's a big way that people find apps, content, news articles, whatever, and they've

114
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:52,770
他们通过抓取网站而获益  而最近几年则通过抓取JavaScript应用而获益
gotten pretty good at crawling websites and in the last few years got good at crawling

115
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:57,170
JavaScript apps.

116
00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:00,160
他们可以渲染它、抓取它并为它建立索引
They can render it, crawl it, index it.

117
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,950
但是你的网站可能因为某种原因而难以被爬虫索引到
But even if your site for whatever reason has a hard time being

118
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:07,570
还有些搜索引擎不支持这种高级抓取方式
crawler-indexed, or some search engines just don't have advanced crawling, now with

119
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:11,550
现在  借助 Universal，Angular 2 具备了预先渲染（Prerender）的能力
Angular 2 there is a capability of pre-rendering using Universal.

120
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:16,491
对于 Web 应用来说  可以轻松获得搜索引擎优化带来的优点
The web apps are the most easy experience that take advantage of

121
00:07:16,491 --> 00:07:17,960
search engine optimisation.

122
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:22,200
借助 Universal 你可以弥补
With universal, you eliminate the downsides before

123
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,690
在搜索引擎优化方面的缺点
you have search-engine optimisation.

124
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:28,760
Hybrid 和 Native 应用中的内容都可以被 Google 搜索到
Hybrid and native app content can appear in Google search.

125
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:33,760
你可以给 Google 一些提示来告诉它如何链接到你的内容
You can give Google hints about links to your content, and they can

126
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,550
然后它就可以在你的 Android 原生应用中打开并在 WebView 中显示这些内容
open it in your native app and show it in the

127
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:39,420
web view on your Android phone.

128
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:43,200
问题在于  它只能由支持 URL 的 Web 应用来使用
But the thing is, it has to be backed by a web app with URL.

129
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,950
所以  你要把内容中的各个部分都告诉 Google “这块儿内容在我的原生应用中”
So any piece of content that you have that you tell Google, "This piece of

130
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:51,430
所以你不得不为它在 Web 上提供一个后备网址（fallback URL）
content is my native app", you have to have a fallback URL to go to on the web.

131
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:56,110
这也就是我们即将谈论的主要方案之一
That's a big theme of the themes we are going to talk about.

132
00:07:56,110 --> 00:08:02,530
指向原生应用的URL是进行索引和分享内容的关键所在
URL with a native app are a key component to index and share content.

133
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:05,610
通过 Web 搜索不是唯一的途径
Web search isn't the only game in town.

134
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,620
手机操作系统提供了操作层面的搜索功能
Mobile operating systems provide operating-level

135
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:15,130
在那里  你可以搜索设备上或 Web 上的内容，并且提供了应用商店的搜索功能
system search where you can search content on your device or on the web, and to provide

136
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:17,560
app store search.

137
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:23,880
而 Web 应用无法出现在对应用商店的搜索中
With web apps, you cannot appear in app store search.

138
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,010
但如果你有一个渐进式 Web 应用 你就能把它安装在手机的首屏
If I have a progressive web app, maybe installed on

139
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:33,060
而 iPhone 和 Android 的应用商店中无论何时都不会出现它们
my home screen and all that, and the iPhone and Android app store don't show those

140
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:36,510
apps for whatever reasons.

141
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:39,370
不过  公开的 Web 应用的内容也可以出现在你的原生操作系统搜索中
Public web app content may appear in your native operating

142
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:41,500
system search, though.

143
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:50,500
我可以在自己的设备上搜索 AngularJS 而下方的播客列表中会描述内容的来源
I can search for my device, Angular JS, podcasts below that it

144
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,780
describes content from.

145
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:56,680
所以  你可能想要在原生JavaScript应用中嵌入Hybrid内容 比如
So, you might need a hybrid for a native JavaScript app if your

146
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:01,060
用户期待在应用商店的搜索中看到这些内容  或者  他们希望使用原生的搜索功能找到你应用中的私有内容
users expect to see you in the app store search or if they want to see your app's private

147
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,590
content using native search.

148
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:05,720
如果有一个 Web 应用  你的公开内容就能显示在
If you have a web app, your content can show up in a

149
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:10,090
原生搜索中  但是只有当你安装了一个原生应用时，才能看到你的私有内容
native search but your private content can only show up if you're installed in a native

150
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,250
app.

151
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:16,080
总而言之  可搜索性就是  如果你的应用及其内容应该被主流搜索引擎发现
In summary of searchability, if your app and its content should be discovered in

152
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:21,040
它就必须支持 Web 爬虫选项
major search engines, there must be a crawler web option.

153
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,650
如果它要出现在应用商店中，它就必须有一个原生版本的应用
If it is in app stores, there must be a native version of the app.

154
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:30,950
如果私有内容需要能在操作系统层面被发现
If the private content is discoverable by operating-level system search, there must

155
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:34,670
它就必须被安装成一个原生或Hybrid版本的应用
be a native or hybrid version of the app installed.

156
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:38,130
可分享性：用户要共享你的内容有多容易？
Shareability: how easily do users share your content?

157
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:40,880
我们先让 Web 支持它
Let's apply this to web first.

158
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,240
如果我要分享照片、内容或别的什么
If I want to share a photo, content, anything,

159
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,940
那就需要开发者给用户指出该如何以及在哪里共享它
it is up to me as a developer to figure out how and where the user can share that.

160
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:51,230
很多次  如果想要从设备上获取照片
A lot of times, if I want to get a photo from the

161
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:55,710
我就要得到一个输入文件  而用户则不得不从文件系统中去选取照片
device, I will have a file input, and they'll have to select a photo from the file system.

162
00:09:55,710 --> 00:10:00,400
这就是因为没有集成原生的gallery（画廊）API或其它API导致的
There's no integration with the native gallery or other APIs.

163
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:05,230
目前  我没有办法让用户做到：我有内容、然后通过原生的共享机制取到它
There is no way for me to say I have the content, now, what the operating

164
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:08,950
再共享到任何地方
native sharing mechanism take over and share it to wherever they have, it is

165
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:19,490
我们只能使用 Web API  所以这个过程不太顺畅 —— 要使用Twilio发送一个文本消息
up to me to work directly with web APIs, so send a text message with Twilio, it is a little

166
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:25,529
为此  用户还要提供一些认证信息
bit more friction, the user has to provide some authentication for those kind of things,

167
00:10:25,529 --> 00:10:26,900
这种体验可不怎么好
so it is not a nice experience.

168
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,330
这个问题正在得到解决
This is being worked on.

169
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:31,521
Chrome 开发组的某些人正在制定从 Web 应用中
Someone on the Chrome team is working on speccing, being able to share

170
00:10:31,521 --> 00:10:34,770
共享的规范
from a web app.

171
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:39,840
处理各种文档的应用可以遵循此规范
Apps that handle that kind of document can take it.

172
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:45,010
另一种实现方式是让开发人员选择如何分享以及
Another way to put is it is the developer chooses how and

173
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:52,250
分享到哪里  但对于原生内容  则只有那些安装了相关应用的用户
where they can share, and whereas on Native, it's up to the user to install apps

174
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,690
才能处理这些分享内容
that can handle sharing content.

175
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:59,740
而问题的另一面在于 Web 应用能处理来自
So, the other side of it is can a web app handle the shares

176
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,740
其它应用的分享吗？
that come from other apps?

177
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,670
目前还没有任何方式能做到
There is no way to do that right now.

178
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:04,750
如果我要从我的图库应用中分享点什么
If I want to share something from my photo app there's no

179
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:10,370
那么对于 Web 应用来说  没办法显示在底部  因此也就没办法选择
way for a just a web app to show up in the bottom part, the part where I select where

180
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:11,950
并分享它
to share it to.

181
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:16,670
还有一些其它的办法为该应用填补这些缺点
But that is also being worked on as part of the complement to the same

182
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:22,339
只要把该应用注册成分享器就行了。
app I'm talking about where apps with be registered to add sharing intense.

183
00:11:22,339 --> 00:11:24,060
我们来看看其它方面，并审视下Hybrid应用和
Let's take a look at the other side and look at hybrid

184
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:27,620
原生JavaScript应用
and native JavaScript apps.

185
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,430
你得到了 Web 所擅长的可伸缩性  也能做到 Web 所能做的一切
You've got the flexibility of the web, you can do everything

186
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:33,839
但同时你还有原生操作系统的支持  于是你可以
you can do with web, but you have the native operating system support, so you can

187
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:38,920
推迟提供这种操作方式  用另一种方式达到分享这些内容的目的
defer to what the operating provides, in terms of share targets for content.

188
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:42,300
Ionic的插件和NativeScript能让你
And plugins for Ionic, and NativeScript make this

189
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:46,440
轻松实现共享  只需要通过少量配置  付出很小的努力就能实现
easy to share with little effort and little configuration.

190
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,960
它们还能处理来自其它应用的分享
They can also handle shares from other applications.

191
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:56,130
你只要声明了自己的应用能处理共享内容
You can declare your app is able to share content, and they can

192
00:11:56,130 --> 00:12:01,340
他们就能共享给你的应用  而你可以用任何自己喜欢的方式处理它  
share your app and you can handle it however you like.

193
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:05,850
总结一下  Web 应用目前受限于通过 Web API进行共享
To summarise, web app is currently limited to sharing with web APIs,

194
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:10,960
而且你没办法处理来自其它应用的共享内容  而原生应用可以整合到操作系统级的共享机制中
and you can't handle shares from other applications, and native can handle OS-level

195
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,370
share integration.

196
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:15,340
如果该功能对你很重要  那么你就需要往自己的实现策略中添加
If that is important to you, then you will need some kind of a native

197
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:18,660
某种原生成分
component to your strategy.

198
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,430
首次使用时的可体验性
First-use experience-ability.

199
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:23,770
用户是如何得到你的应用和内容的？
How does the user get your app and content?

200
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:27,500
显然  用户能越快开始使用你的应用  这种体验就越好
The faster the user can start using your app, the better.

201
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:31,040
谁有问题没？
I don't know if anyone address with that?

202
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,040
好  继续
Okay.

203
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:35,070
如果  点击搜索引擎返回的一条结果  并且立刻看到了餐馆的评价
So, clicking a search engine result and immediately seeing a restaurant review is

204
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:38,210
肯定会比先点击一个链接  然后再安装一个应用  才能看到评价要好一些
better than clicking a link and then installing an app to see a review.

205
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:39,210
后面这些步骤简直是反人类
It is a dig on Yelp.

206
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:41,790
我不知道会不会有人喜欢这样
I don't know if they are popular here.

207
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:45,370
他们总是在一个劲的劝我安装原生应用
They are always nudging me to install the native application.

208
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:49,949
我不得不跳过其它事情  先安装上这个原生应用
I have to scroll through things to get through the native web app.

209
00:12:49,949 --> 00:12:55,860
“安装”这个需求在用户想使用你的应用时凭空增加了很大的阻力
Installation requirements adds friction to the process of users using your app.

210
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:58,680
这些阻力导致了中途放弃  而
Friction turns out to be abandonment, and the abandonment

211
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,300
中途放弃总是很糟糕的
is usually pretty bad.

212
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,980
比如这个例子
For this example, actually, with the -- for this example,

213
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:07,310
Google+的手机应用  当用户拥有这个应用时  他们能显示并点击链接
the Google Plus app, when they have this mobile app that people would show up

214
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:12,149
当显示在屏幕上时  你和共享的内容之间隔着一大堆事情
to and click links, they had a giant thing that showed up on the screen between you and

215
00:13:12,149 --> 00:13:15,520
他们给了你一个链接好让你去访问一个移动站点  但是就因为这个页面的存在
the content, and they have a link where you can visit the mobile site, but they

216
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:26,330
有69%的用户中途放弃了！
had a 69% abandonment rate with this page just by having this here.

217
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:28,410
或许  你可能觉得中途放弃也无所谓
Abandonment might not matter to your app.

218
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:30,480
用户流失也无所谓
People leaving might not matter.

219
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,800
还有一些合理的情况  你也无所谓
There are some legitimate cases where you may not care.

220
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:38,690
如果你的原生应用不得不是原生的  你甚至不会从 Web 上的体验方面受到阻碍
Like if your native app is you have to be native, you can't even get a fraction of the

221
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:42,790
那么需要安装可能也不是坏事  或者可能你只需要面对
experience on web, then maybe installation isn't such a bad things, or maybe you've

222
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:47,500
少量内部用户  他们可以安装一次然后使用好几年
got a small internal app user base, something they will install once and use for years.

223
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:51,910
如果在一个每天处理大量快速信息交流的新闻站或点评站上
You don't care about the installation friction so much as a news site or a review site

224
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:56,940
你可能也不用在乎安装带来的这些阻碍
where you're handling lots of traffic every day for people wanting quick information.

225
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:01,820
所以  决定是否需要安装  需要经过深思熟虑
So the force to pressure installation needs strong consideration.

226
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,750
你应该已经思考过这个问题了吧
You should really give some thought to this.

227
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:07,580
要考虑它如何冲击我们的底线  并且看看你是否能
Think about how it impacts your bottom line and figure out if you

228
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:13,810
轻松的通过移动应用提供更多价值  能否
can ease that a little bit better, provide for value in your mobile app, ease the amount

229
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:15,610
让你轻松给用户大量的暗示
of hints you give to them.

230
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:19,880
Android引入了一些有趣的东西  称为Android原生应用
Android's introduced something interesting called Android

231
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:24,050
通过它  用户可以直接从 Web 访问你的应用而不必先安装它
native apps, where you can access from the web without installing your app yet.

232
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:26,362
这会鼓励用户稍后安装此应用
It may encourage the user to install the app after

233
00:14:26,362 --> 00:14:31,709
这很棒  稍后我们在讲Ionic和NativeScript时会看到
that point, and this is exciting, and I would like to see more integration of this with

234
00:14:31,709 --> 00:14:37,040
更多的集成方式
Ionic and NativeScript.

235
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,930
和你的用户在一起
Be where your users are.

236
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:41,410
移除用户和内容之间的障碍
Remove the obstacles between users and their content.

237
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:45,450
尽可能主动出击  并且通过优雅的提示
Get out of the way as much as you can, and give tasteful hints to

238
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:48,060
让用户了解到你这个可安装的应用
let users know about your installable apps.

239
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:53,120
渐进式应用（PWA）就是一个很好的例子
Progressive web apps are a good examples of this.

240
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,790
在用户使用了它们一会儿之后  它们将在屏幕上给出一个提示
After the user has been using them for a while, they will give a hint on the

241
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,850
“看来你喜欢这个应用
screen saying, "You maybe like this app.

242
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:59,500
你可以把它安装到首屏”
You may want to install it to your home screen."

243
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,480
它不是原生应用  从那一刻开始  用户不用打开浏览器
It is not a native app but they can watch it

244
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,030
就能看到它
from that point but not turned on.

245
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:11,500
最后一部分我们讲下分发：可升级性 —— 你如何把应用给到用户？
The last part of distribution: update-ability - how do you get the apps to your users?

246
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,450
这是用户体验中最关键的部分
This is pretty critical to user experience.

247
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:22,980
如果你的升级过程 —— 如果在你添加新特性或者修改原有的东西之后很久用户才能拿到
If your update process - if the time between you adding features or fixing things is delayed

248
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:27,360
那他们就没法快速访问到这些特性  或是
getting to users, then they don't get access on their features quickly enough, or

249
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:33,050
那些安全补丁  那些关键的性能提升等等  所以  要作出决策就要考虑好
security fixes, or critical performance improvements, so choosing your strategy based

250
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:36,870
你该怎么做才能弥补这段时间的损失
on how you can do this is worth some time.

251
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:41,450
所以  在 Web 上  标准的流程是你作为开发人员把某些东西上传到服务器上
So, on the web, the standard process is you upload something as a developer to

252
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:44,201
而用户只需要刷新一下  就能得到这些
your server, and the user just refreshes, and they've got it.

253
00:15:44,201 --> 00:15:46,140
这样不错
That's not bad.

254
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:49,700

They get it after everything loads, but even with service-worker

255
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,540
now, you can do more advanced loading and the background.

256
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:57,060
The server can say I've got updates, will push them down

257
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,310
service-worker.

258
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:04,130
So the next time the user opens the app, you can reload the app with

259
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:07,220
all the new content without having to fetch anything over the network, so you get kind

260
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:12,080
of a native-like experience with that, but you're still getting fresh content and fresh

261
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,580
fixes, and features for the user.

262
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:17,850
So let's look at hybrid and native just, how their update

263
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:19,270
process works.

264
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:23,880
If you change anything with your apps in binary, or any native features,

265
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,890
you have to republish to app stores.

266
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:28,460
This can halt the process because, with ios, you've

267
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:31,990
got to go - with with iOS, you've got to go through approval and review.

268
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:40,180
Even with manual, you've got to get - you may have to

269
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,180
wait for the user.

270
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,600
They may not know they need to update the app manually.

271
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,170
In hybrid apps, they need to be republished if the

272
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:49,370
native features have changed or embedded content has changed.

273
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:52,430
It's an advantage with hybrid apps that you can have a lot of

274
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:57,581
your content just be remotely loaded in web views, so, if you can change that con tent

275
00:16:57,581 --> 00:17:01,709
- you can change that content as much as you want, and what ships in the device is

276
00:17:01,709 --> 00:17:07,670
not changing, not adding new native plugins or changing the skin loaded on the device,

277
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:14,870
then you don't have to push to the app stores until you add native features, and

278
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:20,770
I know NativeScript is working update-ability to do that as well.

279
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:28,140
Summary: Web provides a path - hybrid and native JavaScript have

280
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:31,610
potentially longer turnaround because of app store review.

281
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:35,280
Delays in automatic updating had potential need for user approval.

282
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,120
So, having covered the distribution, we enough move on to the next major section which

283
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,150
is capabilities.

284
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:44,290
What I'm going to cover here are APIs that are available in

285
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:48,780
native or web, and kind of looking at the discrepancies between what you can do in what

286
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:49,960
places.

287
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:54,170
I'm looking at it as binary that you can or can't do things on the web but

288
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:59,060
it is actually more nuanced than that, and, I encourage you to look some more if there

289
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:07,150
are APIs that you care about, which may be much better on native, much better on the

290
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:15,460
web in hybrid and native apps have access that others don't yet.

291
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:20,330
These may be worked on and are in experimental branches of browsers.

292
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:27,790
Let's look at APIs of note, going to talk about Chrome, and Safari.

293
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:35,330
If you're familiar with - Chrome is limited by Safari because Chrome uses a web

294
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:42,299
view that the operating system provides which is the same is it Safari more or less.

295
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:47,620
I've got the nine categories we will dive into.

296
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,960
Starting with native behaviours.

297
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,220
Look at these later on the slides because I won't review

298
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,570
them in detail.

299
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:55,750
Do I get notifications?

300
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,350
Can I know if I'm in the foreground?

301
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:59,250
Can I set permissions for the app?

302
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:03,350
The short story of this is for iOS web, there is no push notifications

303
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,770
yet and there's no indication when there will be.

304
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:08,990
This depends on them implementing service worker to the spec, which

305
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:12,170
there are some indications they have started but they haven't publicly stated that they

306
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:15,210
have started on implementing service-worker.

307
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:18,070
Then you've got surroundings like how can I interact with the world around me?

308
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:19,420
Bluetooth and NFC.

309
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:23,110
The short story is Bluetooth and Chrome is coming soon.

310
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:28,460
This may be spoke about at the conference, I'm not sure.

311
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:31,150
But iOS doesn't have any web time line, so this is specced.

312
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:37,549
Chrome has as an experiment, and you can play with that today.

313
00:19:37,549 --> 00:19:42,250
Then device features like knowing the network info, battery state, am I online?

314
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:45,210
Being able to control the vibration motor.

315
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:50,510
Short story is: battery network are not availability on iOS web.

316
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:53,980
Are you seeing a pattern!

317
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,020
Android and Chrome.

318
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:57,230
And also worth noting, most other browsers on Android

319
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:00,160
tend to be ahead of the game, too.

320
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,370
Like they have support for Service Workers, push

321
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:08,090
notifications, and install a home screen, so you know I'm focusing on Chrome in these.

322
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:12,669
Getting to seamless experience like how easily do I open the app, does it feel like

323
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:13,669
native?

324
00:20:13,669 --> 00:20:15,900
Does it have an offline mode?

325
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,230
Having home screen installation, so I can launch

326
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:20,910
from the home screen, being able to sync things in the background, being able to

327
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:22,460
communicate with other apps.

328
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,360
The short story is that full offscreen and fullscreen are

329
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:31,080
possible everywhere, but with ioS web it's not ideal, hidden in obscure book marking

330
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:36,160
and meta tags, and that most users don't know enough about to take advantage of.

331
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:41,860
You can do home screen, and it depends on the application cache which has been

332
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:47,820
deprecated and, is pretty riddled with traps and dangers.

333
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:51,500
So then camera and microphone: this is being able to capture

334
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,350
video, doing real time calling and recording.

335
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:59,960
In Chrome, there is a lot of support coming soon that is experimental right now, but for

336
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:06,400
ioS web, no time when you are access these things.

337
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,710
Being able to check screen orientation and stop the screen from going

338
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:09,720
to sleep.

339
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:21,290
IOS web doesn't store this -- input, how do users interact with the device?

340
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:23,970
Touch gestures, speech recognition, which is

341
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:29,070
relatively new for web, clipboard access and fingerprint.

342
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,860
Touch support is everywhere,s that's great.

343
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:33,900
You can have touch events and use libraries that make those easy to work

344
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,380
with.

345
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:42,820
Fingerprint off is something that is pretty - fingerprint auth is available only on iOS

346
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:43,820
hybrid native.

347
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:48,400
I'm sure you could work with Android's.

348
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:53,460
There aren't plugins out the box right now that work with it.

349
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:57,070
And no timeline on when those will be availability in the web.

350
00:21:57,070 --> 00:22:01,840
There is one category where iOS leads, I guess.

351
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:10,080
Knowing where the device is, when they leave and enter a place, and being

352
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:17,460
able to track device-motion events on the accelerometer, gyroscope, sensors individually.

353
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,540
Location - you can know the user's location.

354
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:22,380
Geofencing isn't available on the web.

355
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:28,230
You can hack it or just pull the user's location and check when they've entered a

356
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:32,360
certain area, but you can't say, "Let me know when the user has got to this area."

357
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,420
That's not natively supported.

358
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:39,020
Operating system: so being able to access being able

359
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:47,140
to access offline storage, file system, being able to access APIs like contacts and calendar.

360
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:49,450
Offline storage payments are available everywhere.

361
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:54,299
Safari go Chrome have different implementations, but you can pay with

362
00:22:54,299 --> 00:22:57,120
your native payments integration.

363
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,310
And no contact or calendar access, and there is no

364
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:04,070
timeline or chatter I've seen of being able to work with these things directly.

365
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:07,550
You could use APIs, like if you're using Google apps,

366
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:09,890
access the calendar and contact through that.

367
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:11,370
Not ideal.

368
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:12,669
Going to the performance.

369
00:23:12,669 --> 00:23:17,070
I've got a few things to say here, not a whole lot of depth.

370
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:23,200
60 frames per second, is achievable anywhere.

371
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,830
With the web, you can do it with hybrid, native.

372
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:33,600
Native UI tends to deliver the easiest experience to make this happen.

373
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:39,120
You can leverage them out the box and they tend to be better.

374
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,039
It's worth knowing that a bad performance is just as

375
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,070
easily accomplished on any platform.

376
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:45,460
If you as a developer are lazy and not thinking about

377
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:51,390
performance, you can make something really slow, and I've seen this in practice

378
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:53,530
too many times to recount.

379
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:54,530
You have to be smart.

380
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:56,490
You have to think about performance.

381
00:23:56,490 --> 00:24:00,020
If you're smart and put in enough effort, you can make anything fast.

382
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:03,690
I encourage you to look into these frameworks yourself

383
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:09,770
and experience how they feel, how performant they are and the user experience and

384
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:18,179
how the user perceives the transitions, animations, and interactions.

385
00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:24,330
How effective are you going to be with these different solutions?

386
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:27,870
Four things I would think about with productivity and things that you need to look

387
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:32,320
out on your own, look at how your team works and how well you can play with these

388
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,130
different tools.

389
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:35,130
Testability is a big one.

390
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:37,610
At Angular itself, we care a lot about this.

391
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:40,299
These tools, Ionic, NativeScript, and others in

392
00:24:40,299 --> 00:24:46,200
the system, will leverage testability and built in those lines and this is pretty well

393
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,110
covered by everyone.

394
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:53,100
Having a good testing story, mocking, and unit-testing, is really key.

395
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:56,210
Then community: how active and engaged is the community?

396
00:24:56,210 --> 00:25:00,690
How engaged and excited is the community?

397
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:03,720
Are you going to be able to get help when you get stuck on something?

398
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,720
Extensibility?

399
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,920
Is there a plugin architecture?

400
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:12,350
A time when I get stuck and won't get out of something using one of these

401
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:13,559
tools?

402
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:17,390
And code-sharing: how much code can I share between my application?

403
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:21,049
With hybrid, you could share pretty much your whole application with just a few things

404
00:25:21,049 --> 00:25:22,330
here and there.

405
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:25,640
With native JavaScript or with NativeScript, you could have services

406
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:31,240
or things that are purely JavaScript-shared, but it's up to you to decide how much you

407
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:35,020
can share between the two, and how much that saves you.

408
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,260
I covered a lot of stuff.

409
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:41,870
I probably forgot some things, got some details wrong, but I did get a lot of help from people

410
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:44,640
to make sure I was representing things correctly.

411
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:49,210
So I would like to encourage you to try Angular 2 for NativeScript web and

412
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:50,890
Ionic on your own.

413
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:51,900
Check out the developer experience.

414
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:56,160
They've all done a great job to make it easy to try these things.

415
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,840
Evaluate how well they meet your goals.

416
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:05,480
Thanks to folks from Ionic, and Google, and the help

417
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:09,490
getting the content together for this slide, and in general, just being helpful.

418
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:10,490
Otherwise.

419
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:12,590
Here are the links to the project.

420
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:14,679
I will Tweet the slides and share them later.

421
00:26:14,679 --> 00:26:15,679
Thank you very much.

422
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:15,680
[APPLAUSE].
